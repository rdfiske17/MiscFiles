    <string name="bio_aboutme_heading_en">About Me</string>
    <string name="bio_aboutme_text_en">\t\t\tI am curious about Mathematics as well as Computer and Data Sciences, and embrace the struggle of hard questions as a junior at Concordia College. I utilize a technical background to solve problems in unique ways in all aspects of my life. \n\n\t\t\tI also have an artistic side, pursuing education in language skills and musical competence. I have taken German courses and explore various Germanic languages in my free time. I am an avid musician on and off of Concordia\'s campus, playing Tenor and Bass Trombone in The Concordia Band, Concordia Jazz Ensemble I, and The Concordia Orchestra, as well as subbing for Big Bands in the Fargo/Moorhead area.\n\n\t\t\tI believe that a crossroads between a technical, logical, and artistic mind sets me apart and strengthens my ability to tackle tough challenges.</string>

    <string name="bio_hobbies_heading_en">Hobbies and Interests</string>
    <string name="bio_hobbies_text_en">\t\t\tIn my free time, I like to study and make music, read books, play games, watch movies and television, travel, and study languages. I have been a musician my whole life; I started playing piano in fourth grade and began trombone in sixth grade which turned into one of the biggest parts of my life. I am an avid Star Wars nerd and will digest every bit of Star Wars content I can get my hands on, which is most of the books I read, games I play, and shows and movies that I watch. I love to travel and learn new languages; I have been to Europe twice with an extended trip planned for Summer 2023. I have elementary proficiency in German and have studied the fundamentals of Norwegian.</string>
